English Narrative
Flow Solutions: Pioneering Post-AI Green Energy

Flow Solutions is a next-generation company operating at the intersection of artificial intelligence and renewable energy. We are defining the future of the "Green Energy post AI" sector from our strategic locations in New Caledonia.

Based in the heart of the West Coast's remote "brousse" (countryside) in Poum and Bourail, our team of 150 innovators develops and deploys high-tech, AI-driven solutions to pilot and optimize the production of solar, wind, and tidal turbine energy.

As a fast-growing scale-up, our culture is defined by relentless innovation and a flexible, remote-friendly environment. Our agile structure, characterized by a flat hierarchy, empowers our expert teams in R&D, Wind, and Solar power. A dedicated Community Relations department ensures our advanced projects are developed in harmony with the local environment.

We are committed to solving regional challenges. To counter the shortage of local skilled labor and high training costs, we invest heavily in our people with a dedicated budget of 500,000 XPF per employee, per year, fostering the talent that will power the next wave of green energy.
