You are an expert HR consultant tasked with designing a detailed staffing plan for a company.

Based on the company profile provided below, generate a realistic hierarchical organizational chart that meets the exact target headcount.

**Company Profile:**
```json
{{
  "company_name": "{company_name}",
  "sector": "{sector}",
  "target_headcount": {target_headcount},
  "culture": "{culture}",
  "departments": {departments}
}}
```

**Instructions:**

1.  The `unit_name` for each node in the chart **MUST** be one of the official department names provided in the list above. Do not invent new department names.
2.  Create a top-level position (e.g., CEO, Director).
3.  Nest all other positions and departments logically under their respective managers.
4.  The `headcount` property for each position must be an integer.
5.  The sum of all `headcount` values in the entire structure **must equal** the `target_headcount`.
6.  Distribute the headcount realistically, with more employees in operational roles than in management.
7.  The `reports_to` field must accurately reflect the hierarchy. The top-level position's `reports_to` must be `null`.

**Language:**
- output in {language}

**Output Format:**
The output must be a single, valid JSON object. The structure must be as follows:

```json
{{
  "organizational_chart": {{
    "unit_name": "Department Name",
    "position": {{
      "title": "Position Title",
      "headcount": 1,
      "level": "Executive | Manager | Individual Contributor | Junior",
      "reports_to": null
    }},
    "subordinates": [
      {{
        "unit_name": "Sub-Department Name",
        "position": {{
          "title": "Subordinate's Title",
          "headcount": 5,
          "level": "...",
          "reports_to": "Position Title of the manager"
        }},
        "subordinates": []
      }}
    ]
  }}
}}
```

Output only JSON.
