You are an HR structure specialist.

For the "{unit_name}" department, headed by the "{head_title}", design the full internal position hierarchy.
The company is a {size}-employee business in the {sector} sector.

Define all necessary roles from management to junior levels.
Ensure a clear reporting chain where each position reports to another within the department, ultimately leading to the department head.

The response must be a valid JSON array of position objects. Each object must have:
- "title": string
- "description": string
- "level": string (e.g., "Manager", "Senior Individual Contributor", "Individual Contributor", "Junior")
- "reports_to": string (the title of the position it reports to)

The response must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
```
{{
  "department" : [
    {{
      "title": "Sales Manager - EMEA",
      "description": "Manages the sales team for the EMEA region.",
      "level": "Manager",
      "reports_to": "{head_title}"
    }},
    {{
      "title": "Senior Account Executive",
      "description": "Handles key client accounts.",
      "level": "Senior Individual Contributor",
      "reports_to": "Sales Manager - EMEA"
    }}
  ]
}}
```
Output only JSON.
